# reddit video downloader

I made a script to download reddit video (because maybe someone will find this usefull, I already don't need it anymore)

You just need to have the commands `wget` and `ffmpeg` installed

To use it :
```sh
$ chmod +x redvid-dk.sh
$ ./redvid-dl URL_OF_THE_POST
```

You can also choose to download only the video or the audio with `--video` and `--audio`

It's not a big deal because reddit already split audio and video

### todo :
```
nothing
```
